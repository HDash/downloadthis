The goal of `downloadthis` is to implement download buttons in HTML output from RMarkdown without the need for `runtime:shiny`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `downloadthis` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("fmmattioni/downloadthis")
```

## Introduction

This package builds the download button in RMarkdown using [bsplus](https://github.com/ijlyttle/bsplus), and it was inspired on [this post](https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/embed-file/) from [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui).

## Example

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(downloadthis)

mtcars %>% 
  download_this(
    output_name = "mtcars data set",
    output_extension = ".csv",
    button_label = "Download data",
    button_type = "warning"
  )
```
